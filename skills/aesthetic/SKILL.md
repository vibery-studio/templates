# Aesthetic Design Skill

Systematic framework for creating beautiful interfaces through proven design principles.

## Core Philosophy

**Aesthetic standards come from humans, not AI** - study quality examples and iterate based on objective evaluation.

## Four-Stage Approach

### 1. BEAUTIFUL
Study existing designs to establish aesthetic standards through high-quality examples (Dribbble, Mobbin, Behance) rather than AI intuition alone.

### 2. RIGHT
Ensure functionality, usability, and accessibility standards are met alongside visual appeal.

### 3. SATISFYING
Incorporate micro-interactions with specific timing (150-300ms) and appropriate easing curves.

### 4. PEAK
Elevate designs through narrative elements like parallax effects and thematic consistency, applied with restraint.

## Primary Workflows

### Inspiration Analysis
1. Capture screenshots from design platforms
2. Analyze using AI multimodal capabilities
3. Extract style, typography, color palettes, and component patterns

### Design Generation & Iteration
1. Create design images through prompts
2. Evaluate aesthetic quality (target scores ≥7/10)
3. Refine based on weaknesses in color, typography, or hierarchy
4. Regenerate until standards are met

## Integration

Works with:
- chrome-devtools for screenshot capture
- ai-multimodal for analysis and generation
- media-processing for refinement
- ui-styling for Tailwind CSS implementation
- web-frameworks for development
